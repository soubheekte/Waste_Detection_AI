# Waste Segregation Model AI

Problem Statement:

Manual waste segregation and management is a tedious and time-consuming process that often leads to errors and inefficiencies. This results in a significant amount of recyclable material being sent to landfills and a lack of proper disposal of hazardous waste, leading to environmental and health hazards. Furthermore, the increasing population and urbanization are putting a strain on the existing waste management infrastructure, making it necessary to find new and innovative solutions to the problem.

The proposed solution is the implementation of an automatic waste Segregation system that uses advanced technology such as sensors, cameras, and machine learning algorithms to automatically sort and classify different types of waste, thus reducing the workload of manual waste segregation and improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the waste management process. This system will be able to distinguish between recyclable materials, organic waste, and hazardous waste, enabling proper disposal and reducing the environmental and health hazards caused by improper waste management.
